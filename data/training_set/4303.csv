"The diffusion of silicon in aluminium films at 4% copper of Inm thickness has been studied Over a temperature range of 250-4500C. The frequency factor is Do = 3 . 9 x 10-3 cm2 sec‘l and the-activation energy is evaluated at 0 . 8 eV. the presence of 2 to 8 % copper content in aluminium does not modify the velocity of silicon diffusion, but increases its solubility in aluminium appreciably. These results are explained both in terms of diffusion along the dislocations, and of segregation at the incoherent interfaces between the phase8 (solid solution of the compound A12Cu) and the aluminium matrix.",1

"We shall consider a semi-conducting material composed of a single crystal of silicon of orientation [ l o o ] and a thickness of 400 nm. An epitaxial deposit of silicon contains the transistor junctions (junctions P due to boron and junctions N due to arsenic).",1

"Fig. 1 The current cortduction is maintained by a deposit in the aluminium-copper vapour phase. Apertures performed in the silicon envelope ensure the electrical contact (Fig. 1 ) . The degradation of the properties of these films of the aluminium alloy at 4% copper is produced by a displacement of the interface due to the silicon diffusion. In order to cancel this disadvantageous diffusion, a very thin silicon alloy is deposited on the aluminium-copper alloy. During the thermal treatment, this silicon diffuses to the inside of the conductor and saturates it.",1

"The general study of this phenomenon (distribution of silicon in the film, and measurement of diffusion constants) is the aim of the present article. The aluminium-copper film is obtained byr Torr). evaporation of an alloy heated in a crucible under vacuum The temperature of the substrate is of the order of 250OC. A silicon deposit is formed in the same vessel, immediately after heating. An annealing of some tens of minutes at about 420OC follows the evaporation. This is done :n order to homogenize the copper distribution i and to induce the diffusion of silicon in the alloy. The thickness o f the aluminium-copper film is of the order of 1 nm. The grains have 0.6 nm after deposition and 1.2 nm after thermal treatment. These grains are strongly oriented. Experimentally, a texture [ I 1 3 is observed, which is more or less pronounced when the film is deposited on N+ doped silicon (emitter), as well as a very accentuated texture [110], when the film is deposited on silicon of the type P (base:,,P+ (isolation) or N (epitaxy) (fibre texturesCt+I). Copper is mainly found in the form of A12Cu precipitates. After annealing at 425OC, these precipitates may attain 1 nm. The diffusion coefficients are determined by using the electron microscanner. A concentration gradient in silicon is measured in the aluminium-copper film, starting from a contact hole in silicon (Fig. 2). According to temperature and duration of the thermal treatment imposed 0.3 the semi-conductor, silicon more or less diffuses in the film, and thl? variation of the concentration with the distance ""d"" from the interface provides the diffusion coefficients. These diffusion coefficients are compared with those determined in pure aluminium films [11,[21. It is shown that our results are very near to those obtained i n these cases. The activation energy of diffusion is 0.8 eV. On the other hand, the coefficients D, obtained for the thin layers, are mu'ch higher than those corresponding to massive samples 131. The activation energy is lower, and this suggests the intervention of different phenomena of bulk diffusion and, particularly, the role of reticular defects. Grain boundary diffusion could be the reason for the decrease in the value of activation energy. Nevertheless the fact that the diffusion coefficients have the same values in both pure aluminium and alloy of aluminium and copper, concels this hypathesis. In fact, the grain size is 1 nm in the alloy, whereas it may reach 10 nm in the pure metal. The most probable explanation then is a diffusion along the dislocations, whosedensity is rather high in the film alloy [21. The maximum solubilities of silicon in aluminium with 4% copper were determined by using the Castaing microscanner. The silicon concentration near to the contact hole was taken as the value of the maximum solubility [I]. The obtained results are demonstra.ted in the curve of Fig. 3 . The obtained values are appreciably higher",1

"a t 425OC for copper {contents between 1 6 and 7.6%. The obtained . values are S = 0.33% for pure aluminium and S = 0.50% for all alloys. This result is confirmed by our experiments with the ionic analyzer. An aluminium film, containing a variable quantity of copper, is deposited on a silicon substrate. The thermal treatment at 425OC leads to silicon diffusion in the film until saturation. The ionic analyzer allows the establishment of the concentration profiles of silicon in aluminium and its alloys (Fig.4).It is observed that silicon is uniformly distributed in the film, and that its concentration is higher in the alloys with copper than in pure aluminium. The observed deviation between the solubilities, of the order of 50%, is the same as that which was previously recorded. Therefore, it appears that the presence of copper brings about an increase of solubility of silicon in aluminium. This increase is independent of the amount of copper in the film, obove 1.6% by weight. These result:; allow to advance the hypothesis of a silicon segregation at the interfaces of the matrix A12Cu where the dislocations realize the adjustment between the phaseeand the matrix.
