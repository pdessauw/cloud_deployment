"We shall consider metals which show the most striking differences from the normal self-diffusion. These are the ""anomalous c.c."" metals, . These metals lack all the characteristics of classified in Table 1 normal diffusion. The values of D at the melting point are much larger than the normal values in comparison with The values of Q/Tr extend over a much smaller spectrum than the normal value 34. The same occurs for most of them for the values of A, Moreover, when it is possible to conduct the measurements of I) in a rather wide range of temperature, as for Zn and Ti, the Arrhenius graphs show a high curvature, so that A and Q strongly vary with temperature. Fig. 3 shows the case of 13 Z and r T i 1123 and illustrates how the curvature is much more remarkable than for the near-normal metals Ag, Na, etc. These results were well known f o r a long time and many trials . 2 . Because of the curvature it seems were made to understand them L 1 1 that the explanation should involve two processes, in such a way that D Bhould be again expressed in the form of equation (7). It represents well the results for Zr and T i (Fig. 3 1 , and the resulting values for A!, Q,, A i and Q2 are given in Table 2 . We find that the values of A, and Q , related to the dominant process at high temperatures, are typical for the normal diffusion. Thus, it may be supposed that this process is the vacancy mechanism, and one has to identify the second mechanism associated with A 2 and Q 2 , the values of which are much smaller than the normal values. Most suggested possibilities are shown in the table. They will be briefly discussed because the arguments for and against them are now well known i.121. The first possibility proposed by Kidson [ l s j , i s appealing because all anomalous metals are very difficult to become and remain pure at high temperature, and the required level of impurity is much low. There is a direct evidence that the impurities of this level can affect much the amount of self-diffusion, although the latter is for a normal metal, c.c.Fe [14]. Regarding the diffusion along dislocations, the question is to m-) is know how required the high density of dislocations ( 1 O l G c - ' , produced and maintained, especially at the diffusion temperatures.",1

"I t was advanced that this diffusion takes place due to the transition which these metals undergo on attaining their diffusion temperature and to the resulting immobilization of the dislocations caused by the impurities. Therefore, it may be expected that a rather extended annealing, previous to the annealing of the diffusion, could reduce the density of the dislocations and leads to smaller values of D and less anomalous. Such effect was reported for U Ll51, but a forehand annealing did not affect the self-diffusion of Zr \:16j. If the anomaly is due to dislocations, they appear to be very stable in this metal. For these two possibilities, whether the impurities or the dislocations, we expect differences among the results of diverse origins, but whatever may be the amount of evidence which is introduced, it is not much conclusive. Regarding to the interstitial diffusion, it always involves the problem of understanding the very small values of A,, although the problem does not seem to be very difficult.",1

"There is much evidence to outcast the hypothesis of grain boundary diffusion. More recently, the same model was tried for the weakly anomalous models, of double vacancies at high temperatures and single vacancies at low temperatures [17]. While there is a possibility that the double vacancies play a role, the model appears to be insufficient for T i and Zr, and a third mechanism, for the dislocations is necessary to account for these two metals. Therefore, it seems that none o f these possibilities is entirely satisfactory to account well for the anomalies, but some of them do probably play a role. Another approach towards a comprehension of the anomalies is suggested by the striking fact that the anomalous metals undergo at low temperatures transitions to other phases, usually hexagonal. Moreover, the transition temperatures are rather high and do not fall in the ranges of diffusion measurements. The C.C. metals which do not undergo such transitions are not anomalous. But, the approach towards a transition may involve an increasing instability with respect to the atomic movements in particular directions. If these directions are the same as those in which an atom should undergo a displacement when it jumps, it may be expected that D increases when near the transition temperature.",1

"Because of the great difference between the dependence of A Q on valency in this case, and in the normal systems, it may be interesting to know if the vacancy mechanism should be doubted, since, as we have just observed, the theoretical calculations of 6 Q for the vacancy mechanism were so successful for the normal metals. However, it seems that the screened potential, which is not used in the calculations, was the only involved factor. For the model in its simplest form, we used a simple Thomas- Fermi potential. The properties of this potential lead to the normal dependence on valency. But, one should strictly use a more exact potential, derived from the Hartree equations and which show oscillations in sign beyond a certain distance, whereas at smaller distances, they slightly differ from the Thomas-Fermi potentials. For the monovalent metals, the used potentional is of secondary importance because the oscillations reach beyond the useful distances for a calculation of A Q. This is not the case with the polyvalent metals. For these elements, the oscillation interefere at these distances and produce a great effect on the calculated values of Q , in such a way that there is no reason to find the same dependence of A Q on valency as for the monovalent metals. Recent calculations of A Q for the diffusion in A1 were conducted ; [25] and the necessity of using potentials c f the Hartree type was",1

"Fig. 7 1-27] gives few results for diffusion in Pb, indicating an entirely different type of anomalous behavior. Some impurities like B i , Sn, T1 and N a are found which show all normal propertied in the sense that their diffusion coefficients and their activation energies are close to those for the self-diffusion of P h , But there is another group of impurities, A.$,Ni, Au, P d , Cu, with entirely different properties. Their D values are three to five powers of 10 larger than for the self-diffusion values and their activation energies are only of a third to half of those f o r self-diffusion in Pb. The Cd and H g solutes seem to be of intermediary type. Such exceptionally high D values are not particular to Yb. The diffusion of the model metals and o. some transition metals like Co f and Ni is also as rapid, in comparison with self-diffusion in Sn, In, T1 and the alkali metals, The same behavior is observed, especially for the compact phases in metals Ti, Zr, Hf, the actinides and the rare earths, i e , the metals which appear in Table 1 I: 27, 28, 2 9 , 43.; .. Fig. 8 shows an example of the last class, the diffuoion of Co and the noble metals in Pr 1 O . 3! I n the compact hexagonal phase, D is still much higher than in self-diffusion. Moreover, it is observed that the discontinuit,ies of D and Q on change of the phase are very small in comparison with those of self-diffusion. This is a quite common property to rapid diffusers on a change of phase. Sometimes, the discontinuities are scarcely perceptible, From a vacancy mechanism, such very high values of D are only understoo when the hypothesis is made that they arise from a rather h i g h energy of interaction between solute and vacancy, so that the concentration of the vacancies gets much increased. But this does not actually occur, because such a hypothesis may involve a large increase of the self-diffusion coefficient of the solvent D (c) in presence of a small amountc of the impurity. However, the experiments do not show this behavior, The increase is denoted by a factor b, defined by the equation D (c) = D (0) (1 + bc), and from the vacancy mechanism, it is possible to predict the minimum value of b which is compatible with the measured value of D:>/D<,.

"But with regards to the large divergencies, they are so high that any other mechanism other than the vacancy mechanism has to be admitted to act in these systems. This other mechanism probably acts in case of all other solutes which affect the exceptionally rapid diffusion, although in their case, the direct proof arising from the measurements of b may be lacking. The hypothesis which is actually in progress is that the metals which diffuse that rapidly are the elements which can interstitially dissolve, at least partly. Let C, and c,be the fractions of dissolved atoms of inter5titial and substitutional type and D and D<, their diffusion coefficients. The , , total diffusion is the sum of the two terms i.e.,",1

", It is expected that D, is much higher than D and then, even in the case where ci is quite small, the diffusion could be dominated by the interstitials.",1
"Actually, this hypothesis is emphasized being in the first place in agreement with the geometric considerations. I t appears that all solutes which diffuse rapidly have a rather small ionic radius so that they get easily accomodated on the interstitial sites between the ions of the solvent with a low coverage of ionic cores, or with no coverage at all. This looks to be a very useful criterion to predict the interstitial state. The Hagg rule, which is a similar criterion in terms of atomic radii, is not suitable, probably because it refers to interstitial compounds rather than to very diluted solutions.",1
"f The relatively slight discontinuity o : Dz following a phase change, with examples shown on F i g . 8 , may also be explained by the interstitial hypothesis with geometrical considerations. The large change of self-diffusion may be attributed to the fact that the centered cubic phase is more open than the hexagonal compact phase, and similar changes of D, and D,; may be expected in the equation of D . ,",1

"However, Dr does not change similarly and the reason may be that c ; has a smaller value in the centered cubic phase because the inter.sfitial sites in this phase are smaller than in the hexagonal phase, Aside from the above considerations, and with regards to the phenomenon of a slight discontinuity of D2 when there is an interstitial diffusion in both phases, since the solute diffusion does not much differ from self-diffusion in the centered cubic phase, it may be asked if self-diffusion may take place in this case, at least partly, by the interstitial mechanism. One has to remember that this mechanism was suggested in connection with the behavior of the anomalous centered cubic metals, The valencies of the solute and of th.e solvent are also important in connection with the interstitial solutians. From elementary considerations on the interaction energies of the ions, it may be stated that the interstitial solution is the more probable as the solute valency decreases and that of' the solvent increases. All concerned systems agree with these predictions which further support the interstitial hypothesis 1311. Fig. 9 shows the results of diffusions in Zr as a typical example of the aspect of this dependence o n valency /25)3. D decreases , with the increase of valency, a behavior which is the inverse of that of the normal diffusion. The same behavior is observed for the normal diffusion of some solutes in Li, and it was thus supposed that this solutes undergo interstitial diffusion in Li 1261 For some particular systems, diverse methods may be used in order to confirm or outcast the interstitital solution in the very fast diffusing solutes. For example, the interstitial solution may be concluded for Au dissolved Jn In [32], Na, K /33] and P b 1343 , The measurements were those of the equilibrium distribution of the Also, solute in a centrifuge (ttsedimentationin equilibrium""). there are some results of measurements of the Mossbauer effect, or of the diffusion of electronic or atomic rays (*tchannellingtt) which provided the evidence that certain solutes are found on interstitial sites, for example, Co in Au !35J and In [ 3 6 ] , Au in P b r 3 7 J . Knowledge of the characteristics and particular properties of interstitial defects in different systems, is in its beginning; however such studies are the most advanced for solutes in Pb, Therefore, it appears that the defects are not always the simple or isolated interstitial.",1

This suggests the existence of a bond between the vacancies which conduct the solvent diffusion and the interstitials which a r e supposed to dominate the solute diffusion. Consequently, Miller has proposed that the defects are the pairs comprising a v ~ c a n c ybound to a first neighbor interstitial atom C38-1. Without dealing with the details, this model describes completely 3: the properties of the two systems, Cd [ 8 and Hg 139) in Pb.

"However, in cases where Dl is exceptionally high, and b c i L p less than b,,,,,,as for example the noble metals in P b , it seems that a contrary situation may prevail.

Hithert.0, no quantitative study was made of this situation, in order to be compared with experiment, because of the lack of a rather good knowledge of Lhe interfering parameters. Nevertheless, some data are available which indicate that the defects are not always the simple isolated interstitials. The most striking is that the diffusion of A u in P b decreases with increasing the gold concentration and more strongly when the temperature is decreased, in spite of the fact that the self-diffusion of lead itself increases a little in presence of lead L41'J. This result would have been entirely unexplained by any vacancy model. It could not be more understood by means of the interstitial model than by presuming that in addition to the simple interstitials, there exists also in equilibrium, defects a lower mobility, comprising two, o r more, gold atoms. Since the relative concentration of such pairs increases with the Au content or following a lowering , of temperature, the observed decrease of D takes place.",1

Huntley c423 showed that it is possible, in principle, to arrive to such a low value of A E from the dissociative vacancy-interstitial mechanism of Miller, provided that the biinding energy, vacancyinterstitial, be rather strong. But, it may happen also that it results from the migration from a multi-atomic defect of the abovementioned type. Therefore, it is evident that the interstitial hypothesis is well established to explain the behavior of some particular solutes which diffuse exceptionally fast in some particular metals, but much has to be done in order to determine the details of the structure and the mobility of tl;e defects which will be related to the diV6,iifsystems,",1
